# Grand Migration — Status Board

**Owner:** Rick • **Mode:** Fast path (no detours) • **Updated:** 2025-08-23 21:07

## NEXT (top 3)
- [ ] Merge PR #153 (structured docs stubs) if not merged.
- [ ] Re-run Indexer → `admin/index/*` and fix any new README target issues.
- [ ] Import/migrate any “CoCivium → CoCivium” content queued for today (one folder at a time); open a PR per folder.

## IN PROGRESS
- README canon (hero, crest, Political/Societal/Systemic “Why”), link normalization, and placeholders — **ongoing polish**.

## QUEUED (after migration)
- CoModules pivot tracks (adjacent product/service notes) — resume after core README/doc set stabilized.
- Image pass + design tidy (optional).

## Notes
- Always start with the Indexer to keep links green.
- One PR per atomic change; squash-merge; prune merged branches.
