# Grant Use Alignment Policy (CoFit Access)

## Purpose

To clearly state the conditions under which grant-giving organizations may freely access the CoFit toolset, provided they align with CoCivium’s foundational values.

## No Strings — Just Alignment

This is not a commercial license, a hidden contract, or a subversive agreement. It is a simple public declaration:

> **If your organization’s values align with CoCivium’s principles, you are welcome to use CoFit at no cost.**

## Required Alignment Criteria

1. **Respect for democratic autonomy**: The organization must not use CoFit to justify or perpetuate coercive governance.
2. **Open ethics**: Policies evaluated using CoFit must be made public if implemented with its help.
3. **No proprietary lock-in**: Organizations must not build paywalled tools atop CoFit without community-facing transparency.
4. **Non-surveillance posture**: CoFit cannot be used to justify or deploy mass surveillance policies.
5. **Reciprocal respect**: If CoFit insights are useful, contributors are encouraged—but not required—to share adaptations or improvements.

## Exposure Consideration

The use of CoFit may become publicly visible due to its public impact and possible metadata leakage (e.g., issue filings, adoption logs, or cited analyses). By using CoFit, you accept this visibility.

## Value Justification

CoFit is an ethics-oriented, participatory policy analysis tool. It is offered freely to aligned organizations in the hope that good policy will spread faster than coercion. If your mission is to empower, not extract, you’re in the right place.
