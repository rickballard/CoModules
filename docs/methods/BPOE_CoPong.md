# BPOE — CoPong “Full-Send” (PS7)
Use when the DO Block is safe to run without review.
Pattern to place under a DO Block:
`pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./docs/do/DO-123.ps1`
Notes:
- CoPing = copy→focus→paste (optional Enter) for reviewable steps.
- CoPong = run a small, idempotent script file directly (full-send).
