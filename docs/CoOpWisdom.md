# CoOpWisdom — workflow notes

- Prefer CoWords over raw commands.
- Keep two panes aware via CoTemp breadcrumbs (CoWrap.latest.json / CoPing.latest.json).
- Use Demo mode to explore; switch to Live only for intentional actions.
- If a block is still rendering, use the below-block SafeCopy button (avoid header copy).
- Use “CoCrumbs” regularly; check “crumbs stats” to see how helpful breadcrumbs have been.
