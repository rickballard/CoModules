# CoAgent Integrations Pointer

This repo now contains a Tools Leveraging Initiative under `docs/tools/`.  
CoAgent’s external surface must remain the minimal HTTPS façade defined in `docs/tools/openapi.coagent-facade.yml`.  
All irreversible actions remain behind HumanGate.  See `docs/tools/policies/TOOL_GUARDRAILS.md`.
