# FTW multi-panel workspace (pre-CoAgent)

This guide documents a 3-panel browser layout with **4 concurrent PS7 sessions** in the center column.  
Content moves between panels via **CoPingPong** shortcuts and temporary **CoTemps** files to accelerate multi-agent workflows.  
*(Pre-CoAgent note: this pattern is great for folks not using CoAgent yet—or who prefer bare-metal automation.)*

## Key ideas
- Left & right columns host chat/notes and status panes.
- Middle column: dedicated PS7 tabs per stream; long-running tasks stay isolated.
- CoPingPong: hotkeys push/pull text via **CoTemps** for lossless handoff across windows.
- Plays nicely with DO-GUARD and the BPOE capture scripts.
