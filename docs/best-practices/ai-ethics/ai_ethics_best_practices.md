# AI Ethics â€” Best Practices

- Transparency: all automation visible in repo/workflows.
- Autonomy: always include human override and opt-out.
- Non-coercion: advice must be suggestion, never enforcement.
- Fairness: use diverse, global training sets; avoid vendor lock-in.
- Auditability: maintain decision logs for inspection.
- Congruence: align with CoCivium's principles of openness + autonomy.
