# CareerOS â€” Best Practices (generic, evidence-based)

- Use **evidence-based career models**:
  - Holland Codes (RIASEC) for interests
  - O*NET labor market data
  - Skill taxonomies aligned with ISO/ESCO frameworks
- Always expose weighting (salary, security, passion, growth).
- Include refusal paths: "not for me" should improve personalization.
- Audit AI advice: retain logs for transparency.
