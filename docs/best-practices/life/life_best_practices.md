# LifeOS â€” Best Practices (generic, wellbeing)

- Adopt **WHO and OECD wellbeing frameworks**:
  - Food environment (healthy default choices)
  - Physical activity (150min/week baseline)
  - Sleep hygiene
  - Social connectedness
- No predatory nudges (no affiliate sales).
- Local-first data; encrypted at rest.
- Track outcomes (energy, mood, labs) not vanity metrics.
