# Sora Prompt — GroupBuild Crowd Teaser (≤10s square)

Style. Realistic crowd logistics with subtle UI overlays.  
Prompt. "A busy city square at dusk. Volunteers coordinate a peaceful rally using a minimalist mobile app: map pins converge, safety check-ins flash 'OK', arrows guide foot traffic. The scene feels optimistic, diverse, and calm. End on a clean GroupBuild wordmark placeholder."  
Captions (repo). "Coordinate.  Don’t scramble." / "GroupBuild — consentful crowd tools."
