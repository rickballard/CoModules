# CoBots — Civic Archetype Personas

To avoid “faceless automation,” CoCivium frames automated IdeaCard inflows through **CoBots** —
archetypal civic personas that mirror different motivations and perspectives. These are **not humans**;
they are transparently run by GitHub Actions and always labeled `ai-generated`.

**Why**
1. **Ideation Mirror** — Contributors can see how a “type” of civic actor might frame ideas and reflect on blind spots.
2. **Engagement Catalyst** — Distinct voices invite debate and refinement.

**Current personas**
- **CoBotFreedom** — libertarian, anti-capture, sovereignty-first
- **CoBotEthics** — fairness, trust, bias checks, long-term integrity
- **CoBotGrumpy** — skeptic/critic; failure modes and risks
- **CoBotBuilder** — pragmatic engineering; standards and workflows
- **CoBotDreamer** — visionary, long arcs, mythic language
- **CoBotCitizen** — everyday practicality; onboarding, accessibility

Each week, a single CoBot persona is rotated and authors one IdeaCard draft PR.
