# Session Summary — CoModules / CoAgent BDBP & BPOE (Toronto time)
**When:** 2025-09-05 18:10:16   
**Branch:** `docs/bdbp-coagent-250905-1400`  
**PR:** https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/pull/16

## What we did
- Authored **BDBP perspective** (private) and **public BP** for CoAgent; added **BDBP method**.
- Established **BPOE norm**: any script with long-running ops must show a visible heartbeat/spinner.
- Added **CoHeartbeat.psm1** (PS7 spinner/elapsed) and a **signed CoAgent_BDBP_Setup.ps1** script.
- Created and trusted a **dev code-signing cert** (`CN=CoModules Dev`); signed setup script.
- Normalized line endings with **.gitattributes** (LF for ps1/psm1/md).
- Opened PR #16 and pushed changes to working branch.

## Files added (by path)
- `docs/business/private/CoAgent_BDBP_Private.md` (BDBP — private)
- `docs/business/public/CoAgent_BP_Public.md` (BP — public)
- `docs/methods/BDBP_METHOD.md` (method + public/private convention)
- `tools/BPOE/CoHeartbeat.psm1` (heartbeat/spinner helpers)
- `tools/BPOE/CoAgent_BDBP_Setup.ps1` (signed setup; creates/commits docs with heartbeat)
- `.gitattributes` (LF normalization)
- **To add now:** `tests/BPOE.Heartbeat.Tests.ps1`, `.github/workflows/ps-tests.yml` (included with this summary for commit)

## Decisions
- **Do NOT enable branch protection on `main`** yet (kept open for grand migration).
- Free core (Apache-2.0), paid modules later; GitHub App auth; native package managers; Rust single-binaries; supply-chain hygiene.
- Default to **BDBP** as our planning lens across CoModules.

## Next session TODOs
- Merge PR #16 after review.
- Commit the test + workflow from this summary; verify CI passes.
- Add CoModules-wide bootstrap to roll BDBP/BPOE to other repos (parametrized script).
- Optionally expand the public/private plans with the longer copy.

-- End.
