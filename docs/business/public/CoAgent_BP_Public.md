# CoAgent — Business Plan (Public Summary)
**Date:** 20250905  
**Mission:** Make it effortless and trustworthy for anyone to contribute to GitHub-centric work, across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## What CoAgent Is
A tiny, signed agent (CLI + background service) that helps people **capture**, **prepare**, and **submit** their work to GitHub (Issues, PRs, Discussions) with clear status and built-in diagnostics.  It works offline, survives flaky networks, and keeps secrets in the OS keychain.

## Who It Helps (examples)
- **Open-source projects:** better-structured issues/PRs, faster triage.  
- **Enterprises:** standard, policy-locked paths for inner-source contributions; audit-friendly.  
- **NGOs & Schools:** offline capture, consent-aware submissions, easy onboarding across OSes.  
- **Civic projects (e.g., CoCivium):** consistent “Idea → Decision → Implementation” flows with traceability.

## Why It’s Different
- **Git-native** (no heavy runtimes); **signed & notarized**; **proxy-friendly**; and **template-driven** so submissions are higher quality.  
- **Cross-platform** from day one (Windows/macOS/Ubuntu).

## How It’s Offered
- **Free core (Apache-2.0):** enroll, queue, status/doctor, templates, signed releases with SBOMs.  
- **Paid extensions (later):** organization controls, SSO/SCIM, fleet management, audit exports, white-labelling, curated Job Packs.

## Roadmap (high-level)
Prototype → P0 General Availability (Windows/macOS/Ubuntu) → Enterprise controls → Mobile companions.

## CoCivium Example
For CoCivium contributors, CoAgent turns Idea Cards into Discussion threads or PRs using standard templates and preserves consent and provenance along the way.
