# Grand Migration — PLAN

## Scope (today)
- ☐ Cutlist of repos/assets to migrate
- ☐ Directory + naming conventions
- ☐ Minimal shims / adapters
- ☐ Retire legacy bits (list)

## Steps
1) Inventory + cutlist
2) Create target tree
3) Move modules (atomic, repeatable)
4) Smoke tests (auto)
5) Commit + tag

## Notes
- Keep demo/live switch on until commit step.
- Use breadcrumbs to keep panes in sync.
