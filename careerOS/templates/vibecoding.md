# Vibecoding Basics (generic)

- Treat each session as a *scene*: set intent, constraints, finish with a decision + next action.
- Use a short *evidence ledger*: link facts, decisions, outcomes. Keep it auditable.
- Orchestration: favor small automations (scripts, PRs) over monoliths. Prefer reversible changes.
- Output packaging: README first, working demo second, video/loom third. Reduce review friction.
