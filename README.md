# CoModules
Open-source civic modules with pass/fail validators and public evidence tables.  
Built to satisfy real standards (OMB M-24-10, ATRS, DCAT-US/DCAT-AP, OCDS, BODS).  
Free to test out and use.  

Partners include:
- InSeed (strategy consultancy, offering hosted validators, workshops, and light implementation).
- GroupBuild (a policy advocacy organizer)
- CoCivium (an open source community, building AI-tools for digital societies)
- Multiple charities and not for profit organizations

## Modules (alpha):

AI System Registry & Impact Tracker — publish your AI inventory, risks, and mitigations with machine-checkable templates; auto-generated public site & badges. 

Open Procurement Starter — CSV→OCDS & BODS linkage, DCAT snippets, and one-command validation with official tools. 

## Why CoModules?

1. It's free
2. Standards-anchored (not bespoke websites).
3. Evidence-first (IRM-style evidence tables in repo).
4. Open Government Partnership
5. Portal-agnostic (CKAN, Socrata, OpenDataSoft, data.world).
