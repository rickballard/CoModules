# CoModules
Open-source civic modules with pass/fail validators and public evidence tables.  
Built to satisfy real standards (OMB M-24-10, ATRS, DCAT-US/DCAT-AP, OCDS, BODS).  
Free to test out and use.  

Partners include:

- GroupBuild (a policy advocacy organizer)
- CoCivium (open source community building AI-tools for digital societies)
- Multiple charities and not for profit organizations

4. Open Government Partnership
5. Portal-agnostic (CKAN, Socrata, OpenDataSoft, data.world).
