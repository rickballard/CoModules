# CBPP — Civic Best Practices Pipeline

Reusable building blocks:
- `crosswalks/` — how our fields map to standards (e.g., OMB→ATRS, CSV→OCDS)
- `checklists/` — machine-readable “must/should/test” sets
- `evidence/` — Evidence Table patterns and examples

Keep it short. Each file should be human-readable and script-friendly.
