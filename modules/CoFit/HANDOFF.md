# HANDOFF: CoFit Initiative

## Purpose
This document marks the current state of the **CoFit (CivicFit Engine)** initiative, documenting its rationale, placement in the ecosystem, and how to resume work.

## Scope
- CoFit is a modeling tool to predict how well civic solutions meet real-world demand.
- This doc assumes Rick (initiator) and assistant co-led ideation; this branch was set up by the assistant.
- Repo: `CoModules`, location: `modules/CoFit/`

## Status Summary
- ✅ Seeded module: `modules/CoFit/`
- ✅ Draft `TODO.md` with clear outlines
- ✅ This `HANDOFF.md` as repo breadcrumb
- ⏳ No MVP chosen yet
- ⏳ No modeling logic implemented

## Resume Strategy
Anyone picking this up should:
1. Review `TODO.md` to understand next planned artifacts.
2. Read the “Business Plan” draft Rick mentioned (likely still in notes or oral form).
3. Confirm if CoFit should lead with:
   - a user-facing tool (e.g. “fit my idea” form)
   - or a behind-the-scenes score generation engine (e.g. AI agent scoring solutions).

## Hand-off Token
This file serves as a durable marker. If you found this, the assistant is ready to regenerate strategy from here.
