# Values Guardrails

- No coercion. Suggestions must be opt-in and reversible.
- No affiliate or commission links. Remove vendor bias.
- Respect identity, neurotype, and boundaries.
- Evidence over hype; measured experiments; publish learnings.
- Data minimization; encrypt at rest; clear off-ramps.
