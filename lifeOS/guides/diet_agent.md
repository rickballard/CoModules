# Diet Agent â€” Healthy-by-Default

Goal: ensure the home environment makes healthy choices frictionless.
- Home inventory profile (foods allowed, intolerances, budget, prep time)
- Trusted vendor list (local co-ops, farmers markets, vetted delivery)
- Weekly auto-plan: balanced macros, culturally affirming meals, quick prep
- Refusal/guard: block predatory upsells; no affiliate-driven suggestions
- Audit: monthly check on outcomes (energy, sleep, mood, labs)
