    "title":  "Fix The World — The Game (FTW/FTWTG): Guardian Mode (Screen Nanny / Coach Mode)",
    "summary":  "Extend FTW with an optional kid-facing coach that balances screen time by exchanging short, themed learning quests for additional game time; integrates with OS parental controls; neurodiversity-friendly (visual prompts, predictable transitions, token economy).",
    "rationale":  "Existing parental-control tools enforce time but don’t engage; ADHD/autistic kids respond better to immediate, concrete rewards and visual schedules. FTW can turn friction into fun by embedding just-in-time learning quests tied to the game’s narrative.",
    "impact":  "Higher adherence with less conflict; measurable gains in learning minutes; differentiated edtech positioning; school-safe while still fun. Creates a moat vs. blunt blockers by pairing engagement with enforcement.",
