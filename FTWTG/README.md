# Fix The World — The Game (FTW)

**Vision:** A kid-friendly, school-safe game that turns “more screen time” into “more learning” via short quests tied to the game narrative.  
**Stretch Target:** **Guardian Mode** (Screen Nanny / Coach Mode) that trades small learning tasks for additional play minutes, integrating with OS parental controls.
