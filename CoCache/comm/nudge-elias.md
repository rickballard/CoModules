Subject: quick nudge — your careerOS starter is waiting (stable links inside)

Hi Elias,

Just checking in gently. The two-part careerOS starter we sent is still ready whenever you are.
Both links below are **stable** for at least a month (and we’ll happily refresh them anytime):

Part 1 – Generic (safe demo):
https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/releases/download/v0.1.0/careerOS_generic_v2.zip

Part 2 – Personalization (your starter content):
https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/releases/download/v0.1.0/careerOS_personalize_v2.zip

If you’d like, we can also point you to the latest enhanced bundles (no change to your Part 1/2 flow):
- careerOS generic v3: https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/raw/main/dist/careerOS/careerOS_generic_v3.zip
- careerOS personalize v3: https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/raw/main/dist/careerOS/careerOS_personalize_v3.zip
- lifeOS generic v1: https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/raw/main/dist/lifeOS/lifeOS_generic_v1.zip
- lifeOS personalize v1: https://github.com/rickballard/CoModules/raw/main/dist/lifeOS/lifeOS_personalize_v1.zip

No rush at all. We’re here when you’re ready.
